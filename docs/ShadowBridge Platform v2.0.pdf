Security Considerations
Production Deployment
• Use HTTPS for all communications
• Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
• Configure CORS for specific domains only
• Use strong JWT secrets and rotate regularly
• Implement proper logging and monitoring
Data Protection
• All user data encrypted in transit and at rest
• JWT tokens expire after 7 days
• Password hashing with bcrypt
• Input validation and sanitizationSupport & Maintenance
Monitoring
• API health endpoint: /api/health
• Database connection status
• JWT token validation
• User registration and login metrics
Backup & Recovery
• Regular database backups
• Configuration file versioning
• API endpoint documentation
• User data export capabilities
